Quorum is an Ethereum-based distributed ledger protocol with transaction/contract privacy and new consensus mechanisms.

Quorum is a fork of [go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) and is updated in line with go-ethereum releases.

Key enhancements over go-ethereum:

* __Privacy__ - Quorum supports private transactions and private contracts through public/private state separation, and utilises peer-to-peer encrypted message exchanges (see [Constellation](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/constellation) and [Tessera](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/tessera)) for directed transfer of private data to network participants
* __Alternative Consensus Mechanisms__ - with no need for POW/POS in a permissioned network, Quorum instead offers multiple consensus mechanisms that are more appropriate for consortium chains:
    * __Raft-based Consensus__ - a consensus model for faster blocktimes, transaction finality, and on-demand block creation
    * __Istanbul BFT__ - a PBFT-inspired consensus algorithm with transaction finality, by AMIS.
* __Peer Permissioning__ - node/peer permissioning using smart contracts, ensuring only known parties can join the network
* __Higher Performance__ - Quorum offers significantly higher performance than public geth

## Architecture

![Quorum Tessera Privacy Flow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jpmorganchase/quorum-docs/master/images/QuorumTransactionProcessing.JPG)

The above diagram is a high-level overview of the privacy architecture used by Quorum. For more in-depth discussion of the components, refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/quorum/wiki) pages.

## Quickstart
The quickest way to get started with Quorum is by following instructions in the [Quorum Examples](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/quorum-examples) repository.  This allows you to quickly create a network of Quorum nodes, and includes a step-by-step demonstration of the privacy features of Quorum.

## Further Reading
Further documentation can be found in the [docs](docs/) folder and on the [wiki](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/quorum/wiki).
